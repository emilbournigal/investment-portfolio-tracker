Final Project Emil Bournigal
I made a web app for tracking stock investmets. The user can input the stock symbol, amount of shares bought, purchase price and then see how the stock is performing for them. Also has a pie chart that gives you a better overview of the portfolio.

Features to add in the future:
I would like to add a way to sell stocks in the portfolio and for that to account as "cash"
Also maybe incorporate some risk analysis.
Also another thing that I could not incorporate and I acknowledge is a major flaw of the project is that if you add the same amount of stock twice it counts as 2 different stocks in the pie chart. 

All the stock data was for yfinance which is Yahoo Finance library.
